# OS1
The first Operating system class in the computer science departments. The official class code is CS344. 
This was taken Fall of 2023. The two hardest assignments were the small shell and one-time pad (OTP) encryption assignments.

Small Shell is in another repository but OTP is available here. Small shell is a lite version of the Linux terminal using 
features included in the Linux system, it is practice for building apps that need to be run in the terminal, think servers,
or in my Computer Engineering track, I've seen used in my internship with Siemens EDA (EDA tools). 

OTP is an assignment for the practice of client-to-server communication.
