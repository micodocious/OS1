 * Let's declare some file-scope variables and macros. Everything here is not externally visible,
 * and pertains only to this file. Macro definitions only affect the files they appear in, and the
 * static specifier indicates file-scope (not externally linked). Since everything here is local to
 * this file, you can change it, remove it, etc. It's *your* implementation, do what *you* want!
 *
 * Only extern symbols enter the global namespace and are "imported" by the linker, which matters
 * when you're working with multiple source files/libraries/etc. as we are here. We want some things
 * like print_tree() to be external, so that the libtree library can access it, but pretty much
 * everything else is part of the print_tree() implementation and should be file-scoped. 
 */
     
/* This is an example of conditional inclusion using preprocessor directives. Here we define a
 * function-like macro: pdebug(...), which calls fprintf if the DEBUG macro is set; otherwise it
 * does nothing. The `gcc` compiler accepts arguments of the form -D MACRO_NAME[=value] to set a
 * macro at compilation time, which can be used to turn debugging output on or off.
 *
 * Notice the space between "#" and "define". The '#' must appear in column 0, but there can be
 * whitespace between it and the directive. This is typically used to visually indicate nesting
 * levels inside #if blocks
 * 
 * Example: gcc -o tree -DDEBUG tree.c -ltree
 *
 * Important note: 
 *     Be careful about inline comments and the #define directive! They will become part of the
 *     macro! The preproccessor does not know or care what C is! It follows simple, but sometimes
 *     confusing, macro replacement rules.

 * print_tree() - Recursively print subdirectory tree of given path
 * @path: The path of the starting directory
 *
 * print_tree() prints the contents of the given directory at @path, recursing through each
 * subdirectory to print its contents as well. Each level of depth is indented by two spaces.
 *
 * This function will be the entry point of your program. The libtree library defines its own main()
 * function which parses arguments on the command-line and then calls into your print_tree()
 * function with a given path. When you link against the libtree library (with gcc ... -ltree), the
 * symbols provided in the library become available, and you end up with an executable program.
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 * If there were no errors, print_tree() returns 0. If there is an internal error, print_tree()
 * should immediately return a non-zero value *without* printing anything about the error. It is ok
 * if print_tree() has already produced some output before the error occurred.
 * 
 * print_tree() may change the current working directory; the caller is responsible for restoring it
 * if necessary.
 *
 * Writes to stdout and stderr may be assumed to always succeed and do not need to be checked for
 * errors.
 *
 * Failure to open the specified directory or subdirectory at @path should not be treated as an
 * internal error. Instead, print_tree will print an informative message as part of its regular
 * output (on stdout). See the example code below.
 *
 * Most of this program has been completed for you!
